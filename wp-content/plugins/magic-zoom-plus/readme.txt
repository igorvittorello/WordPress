Magic Zoom Plus™ provides two ways to zoom images using JavaScript and CSS.

== Description ==

To see an image in greater detail, hover cursor over the image and a zoomed area will appear to the side.

Alternatively, click the image to enlarge it to full-screen. A great option when using thumbnail images as well as a main image, as this functionality provides a scroll feature through all the images displayed on your web page.

* Zoom position set by external id
* Zoom alignment to main image
* Title on inner zoom
* External source of a title
* New pounce effect for switching multiple images
* Initialization on hover
* Hide zoom window on click
* CSS class for an active selector
* Shadow and glow effects behind zoom
* Option to swap images only (disable zoom and expand)
* Show/hide right-click menu
* Option to translate button tooltips
* New API methods for expand and restore
* Click anywhere to close expanded image
* Automatically re-position zoom window to fit page
* Hotspot feature
* Smooth mouse movement
* Fade zoom in/out
* Special effects for expanding
